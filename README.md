# Minetest old call update V3
## This is not a minetest mod
**1: USE OF YOUR OWN RISK**
**2: THE SCRIPT/APPLICATION IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.**
**3: I (AiTechEye) DO NOT TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY DAMAGES AND ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY KINDS OF DAMAGES.**
**4 the code are CC0**

**This script/application should work fine with windows 7 and newer, unsure about older os.**

***Only use this app if you know what you are doing, some calls eg "get_2d_map_flat" isn't supported in mt 0.4.16 and older

This script will simply replace all of this old calls in lua-files, in all sub folders and creating a log about what it finds.
Only use this with copyes of your stuff, if something goes wrong there are no going back.


Put your files or whole mod/modpack/game in the "Minetest old call update" folder (created in first run).
As standard you will get a warning about using unknown vbs script, but just ignore it and run.
